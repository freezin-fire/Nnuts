# Nnuts
Welcome to the readme section of my open-source c++ based game engine - Nnuts!
In this document, you'll find all the information you need to get started with the project.

## Overview
Nnuts is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented, however (almost) everything inside this repository is being created within YouTube videos, found at thecherno.com/engine.

Also I would recommend subscribing to The Cherno on youtube and follow him on github. He is a great teacher and an awesome youtuber with other study resources also by him.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Nnuts is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

<ins>** Downloading the repository:**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/freezin-fire/Nnuts`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

Run Premake build.bat to generate the project files.

## The Plan
The plan for project Nnuts is to make a powerful 2D and 3D Game Engine, while keeping it free and open-source. This project will not only provide a solution as an application but is also helping me to grow and understand a lot of aspects in Programming and Computer Architecture.
Since I am the only one working on the project it will take quite some time to complete, but the wait will definitely will be worth it.

### Main features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
    - Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Fully featured viewer and editor applications
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Audio system

## Goal:
I am aiming to complete at least the 2D rendering part of the Engine before the end of 2023, but I am definitely aiming to finish it as early as possible because the development process is also quite fun
